									<h3 class="major">Let me introduce myself</h3>
									<p>Hello! My name is Logan Reneau. I am a software engineer located in Grand Rapids, Michigan. I primarily work in Mobile Applicaiton Development and enjoy the challenge the field presents </p>
									<p>With the formalities out of the way, we can dig into learn more about me. To best do this, I have broken this up into three separate sections: history, motivation, and hobbies.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="inner">
									<h3 class="major">History</h3>
									<p>I was born in Royal Oak, Michigan on June 21st, 2001. I was brought into a family with two loving parents and an older brother I was destined to annoy (as younger brothers do). I give most of the credit of my success to my upbringing. My parents made sure that I was always supported while my brother always pushed me to be the best I could be. They gave me the opportunity to make mistakes and learn from them. To say I am a family man would be an understatement. I could not be where I am without them.</p>
									<p>	Growing up I loved 3 things: video games, sports, and helping people. I always have had a knack for looking out for the people around me. Naturally, I was drawn to the medical field. With this in mind, I started my post-high school education in pre-med. I have worked as an Emergency Medical Technition and a Nurse Aid. While the medical field is a great
										place to create a career in, I felt as if there was a piece missing. So two years into university I decided to do a complete 180 and switch my major to Computer Science. Little did I know this would be the best decision I ever made.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="inner">
									<h3 class="major">motivation</h3>
									<p>As previously mentioned, I have always loved video games. Growing up I spent a good chunk of my time playing my xbox, enjoying the boom in online video games in the late 2000's - mid 2010's. 
										So when I moved out of my house and set course for college, it was natural that I would want a PC to help with school work and play games on. After getting all of my parts, I built it and immediately fell in love. Through multitasking and plently of in game hours I found myself getting to know more and more about computers. Knowing my way around a PC, when I made the switch to Computer Science, it was like a match that was written in the stars.</p>
									<p>When I made the switch to Computer Science I was nervous. I knew nothing about it other than I would be 'coding'. Little did I know this career path would fit me like a glove. My grades in my new classes were immediately better then I previously had. I enjoyed going to class and learning about this field. It was the first time in a long time that I had passion to learn. From creating my first terminal program to developing an app for my senior project, each task I had been given had intellectually stimulated me in a way that nothing had in the past.</p>
									<p>To put it bluntly: I can't get enough of the challenges that this field presents.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="inner">
									<h3 class="major">Hobbies</h3>
									<p>As previously mentioned, I love video games. This matched with the ever growing phenomenon of Esports helped me to find a community when I first landed at GVSU. After trying out for the varsity team of my favorite game, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege, I was put on the team and was able to make friendships that I still have to this day. 
										My role on the team was the IGL (or In Game Leader). This made me responsible for organizing the team and leading them on strategies. Being on this team helped to reinforce certain soft skills as well: Communication, Active Listening, and Leading are just some of the few. To this day I still play siege with my team, just not in a comptitive setting, rather in a more casual one.</p>
									<p>Another ture passion of mine is Bowling! </p>
